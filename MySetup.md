# Overview

I want to be able to run a single WinGet configuration by passing in the URL to my configuration file like:

```
winget configure https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/denelon/main/denelon.dsc.yaml
```

This should result in making Windows feel like home with all my favorite apps and settings.

Some of the things I want setup below might be listed in more than one place. I'm not sure if it makes more sense to have them in one particular DSC Resource as opposed to another.

>**Note:** My thinking will be influenced by how `winget export` should work in the future so I could make changes to my local device and simply check the new configuration into my setup repository.

## Gaps and potential workarounds
* WinGet CLI is in a packaged process so when WindowsOptionalFeature is used, the DISM APIs aren't reachable.
  * Use Get-WinGetConfiguration | Invoke-WinGetConfiguration
* Elevation issues
  * Use two configuration files. One required authentication, the other doesn't require (or prohibits elevation)
